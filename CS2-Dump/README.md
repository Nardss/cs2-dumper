# CS2 Basic Dumper

This repository contains a basic dumper for CS2. The project is designed to be simple and straightforward, including only the essential files: `client`, `offsets`, and `buttons`. These files will be updated as needed to keep the dumper functional with the latest game updates.

## Project Structure

- **client**: This file contains the core functionalities of the dumper, handling the main interactions with the CS2 client.
- **offsets**: This file includes the memory offsets required for the dumper to operate correctly. These offsets will be updated regularly to ensure compatibility with the latest game patches.
- **buttons**: This file manages the in-game buttons and interactions, providing the necessary hooks and handlers.
